# Spindle Thread Bot
A project we are working on to save Twitter threads.
To use this bot, follow the given instructions:

Just go to Twitter https://twitter.com and follow the bot @Spindle_Thread https://twitter.com/Spindle_Thread.
Now, go to the Twitter tweet that you want to save.
Tag the bot in the replies to the tweet, ie, reply to the tweet with the tag @Spindle_Thread.
In a few seconds, you will get an image of the tweet sent to your direct message (check your inbox). It will also contain a link to the thread. A download link will be provided if you wish to download a PDF of the tweet.

This bot uses the Tweepy API to function https://www.tweepy.org/.
It also uses the GrabzIt client https://pypi.org/project/GrabzIt/ to get an image of the tweet.
It also uses the DropBox API https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/python to generate the download link for the PDF
