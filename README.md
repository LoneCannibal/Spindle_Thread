A project we are working on to save Twitter threads 
To use this bot, follow the given instructions:

Just go to Twitter.com and follow the bot @Spindle_Thread.
Now, go to the Twitter tweet that you want to save.
Tag the bot in the replies to the tweet, ie, reply to the tweet with the tag @Spindle_Thread.
In a few seconds, you will get an image of the tweet sent to your direct message (check your inbox). It will also contain a link to the thread.
